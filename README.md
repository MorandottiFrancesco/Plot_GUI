# Plot_GUI
GUI interface to plot with matplotlib data in the CVS file format. It is specifically designed with Candence Virtuoso raw output data since the ViVa Result Browser offered by Cadence is flexible and supports many tools, but is impractical and ugly in generating simulation results waveforms and displaying data for design reviews and documentation.

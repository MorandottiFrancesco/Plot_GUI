# Plot_GUI
GUI interface to plot with matplotlib data in the CVS file format. It is specifically designed with Candence Virtuoso raw output data since the ViVa Result Browser offered by Cadence is flexible and supports many tools, but is impractical and ugly in generating simulation results waveforms and displaying data for design reviews and documentation.

A cool feature allows to select what is to be plotted against what and supports up to 4D plots (X, Y, Circle Color, Circle Area) to produce bubble plots with aggregated expressions and outputs coming from the simulation enviorement. It also allows to plot any output of the CVS matrix against any other.
